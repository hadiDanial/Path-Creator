# Path-Creator

This fork started with me trying to use this asset in a game project, and ended up with me just adding things for the hell of it. It's pretty fun, and bound to be very useful!

Additions to the main repo:

Path generators, with custom inspectors

Path to sprite shape conversion (will be readded soon)
